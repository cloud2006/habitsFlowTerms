        <li><strong>2. Use of Analytics:</strong> We may use third-party analytics providers (such as Firebase Analytics) to help us understand aggregate trends and user behavior. This may include information such as device type, session duration, and feature usage. These data are collected anonymously and cannot be used to identify individual users.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Security:</strong> We implement reasonable safeguards to protect data stored locally on your device. However, users are responsible for maintaining the security of their devices and iCloud accounts.</li>
